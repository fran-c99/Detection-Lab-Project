# Home Detection Lab | Project

## Objective

The Home Detection Lab project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for: simulating and detecting cyber attacks and enhance privacy, security and control over internet traffic. Based on my primary objectives I implemented the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool "Wazuh" in a PC running Linux and a cloud-based DNS service,
This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of system vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and defensive strategies as well as a better understanding on network analytics. 

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- DNS setup for multiple devices and on various operating systems.
- Installation and setup of a SIEM tool.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
