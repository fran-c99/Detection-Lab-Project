# Home Detection Lab | Project | WORK IN PROGRESS

## Objective

The Home Detection Lab project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for: simulating and detecting cyber attacks and enhance privacy, security and control over internet traffic. 

Based on my primary objectives I implemented the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool Splunk in my PC and a cloud-based DNS service. In addition, I setup a Virtual Machine running Windows 11 as the target machine and Kali Linux as the m. Then using wireshark and nmap to have a better understanding of how the information over the internet is working and to be able to check vulnerabilities based on the ports that the system is using.

This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of system vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and defensive strategies as well as a better understanding on network analytics and troubleshooting of different Operating Systems in a Cybersecurity Setting. 

### Tools Used

- Splunk (SIEM)
- Wireshark & Nmap (Network analysis tools and Pentesting)
- Nessus (Vulnerability Scanner)
- Portmaster (firewall running NextDNS as the DNS server)
- UTM (Virtual Machine)

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- DNS setup for multiple devices.
- Installation and setup for Nessus in Kali Linux.
- Installation, setup and usage of a SIEM tool.
- Understanding Firewalls and their uses.
